# SVG Notes

This is a library for handling graphical note taking inside of SVG.

This is only about Parsing and Writing the Data.

This is mainly developed for _Insert Creative Name Here (ICNH)_, my SVG sketch app developed in Godot for use with GitJournal.

The Idea of SVGNotes is to have a file Format that any SVG Renderer can Render, but that holds all Information required by _ICNH_.

This includes:
- [ ] Shapes (Sphere/Rectangle/Triangle etc.)
- [ ] Lines (With variable width)
